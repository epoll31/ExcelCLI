# Excel CLI

This is a quick demo that I made to read and modify Excel documents in the CLI using Python.

## About This Demo

This demo stores usernames and passwords in Excel documents uisng the CLI.

- You can perform the following actions from the CLI
    - Log in
    - Sign up
    - Remove your account
    - Swap the file

Althought this is a basic example, it shows that I can use Python to create CLI's that read and alter Excel files.
